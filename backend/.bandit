# Bandit security configuration for My First Bank App
# This file configures which security tests to run and which to skip

# Skip specific test IDs that are not relevant for our use case
skips: ['B101', 'B105']

# B101: assert_used - We use assertions in tests, which is expected
# B105: hardcoded_password_string - Test files contain test passwords, which is safe

# Exclude virtual environment and cache directories
exclude_dirs: ['.venv', '__pycache__', '.pytest_cache', '.mypy_cache']

# Set confidence level (Low, Medium, High)
# Only report issues with Medium or High confidence
confidence: ['MEDIUM', 'HIGH']

# Set severity level (Low, Medium, High)
# Only report issues with Medium or High severity
severity: ['MEDIUM', 'HIGH']
