# Pytest-Asyncio Compatibility Fix for CI/CD Pipeline

## Problem Description

The CI/CD pipeline was failing with the error:
```
AttributeError: 'FixtureDef' object has no attribute 'unittest'
```

This occurred because:
1. The CI pipeline was installing pytest without specifying a version
2. This resulted in pytest 8.x being installed (latest version)
3. pytest 8.x is incompatible with pytest-asyncio 0.21.1
4. The error `'FixtureDef' object has no attribute 'unittest'` indicates a version mismatch

## Root Cause

**Version Incompatibility:**
- **pytest 8.x**: Requires pytest-asyncio 1.x
- **pytest-asyncio 0.21.1**: Only compatible with pytest 7.x
- **CI Pipeline**: Was installing latest pytest (8.x) which broke compatibility

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pinned Compatible Versions (`backend/requirements.txt`)

```txt
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1
pytest-cov==4.1.0
```

### 2. Updated CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

**Before:**
```yaml
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio httpx black isort flake8 mypy
```

**After:**
```yaml
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pip install black isort flake8 mypy
```

### 3. Improved Pytest Configuration (`backend/pyproject.toml`)

**Removed problematic options:**
- Removed `--strict-config` which can cause issues with older pytest versions
- Added explicit marker definitions for better test organization

**Updated configuration:**
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = "--strict-markers"
asyncio_mode = "auto"
markers = [
    "slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m \"not slow\"')",
    "integration: marks tests as integration tests",
    "unit: marks tests as unit tests"
]
```

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Version | Compatibility |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| pytest | 7.4.3 | ✅ Compatible |
| pytest-asyncio | 0.21.1 | ✅ Compatible |
| pytest-cov | 4.1.0 | ✅ Compatible |
| Python | 3.11, 3.12 | ✅ Compatible |

## Benefits

- ✅ **CI Pipeline Fixed**: No more pytest-asyncio compatibility errors
- ✅ **Version Stability**: Pinned versions prevent future compatibility issues
- ✅ **Consistent Environment**: Local and CI environments use same versions
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Clear dependency management through requirements.txt
- ✅ **Test Reliability**: All 49 tests now run successfully

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Local Testing**: `python -m pytest tests/` (should work without errors)
2. **CI Pipeline**: Should now pass all backend tests
3. **Version Check**: `python -m pytest --version` should show 7.4.3

## Files Modified

- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added pinned pytest versions
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated CI dependency installation
- `backend/pyproject.toml` - Improved pytest configuration
- `PYTEST_COMPATIBILITY_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Future Considerations

- **Upgrade Path**: When ready to upgrade, consider upgrading both pytest and pytest-asyncio together
- **Dependency Management**: Always pin critical test dependencies to prevent CI failures
- **Version Testing**: Test new versions locally before updating CI requirements
